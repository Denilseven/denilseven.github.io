        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Denilson</b> (or Denil for short) and I'm a 16yo boy who likes to create cool stuff and play some games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I always made my own fun since I was <i>veri smal</i> using building blocks,
        then I started cutting and gluing together paper and cardboard to craft toys, then I started using MS paint to draw and PowerPoint 2010 to create..
        games, then a few years later I found out about Scratch and nowdays I'm learning how to make <b>video games and code!</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        My <b>favorite things to do</b> are walking in the woods and playing/creating games.. sad thing I can't do both at the same time.

        <h2>What I've been doing</h2>
        <p>
        In the last few months I've been mainly studying and playing games but I have a lot of things in mind,
        like <b>creating more complex games</b> that have a start and ending point or <b>finally recording my first YouTube video.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The latter is a bit tricky though because
        (as you may have noticed) I didn't grow up speaking english, so I've been <b>training my pronunciation</b> to sound reasonably good.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I'll update this part of the website when I get some project going on.
