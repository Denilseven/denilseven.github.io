        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        <b>My name is Denilson</b> and I'm a 16 years old boy who enjoys creating stuff and playing some games.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <i>I remember playing with building blocks and cardboard as a kid, creating whatever my imagination
        would bring to me, I would build castles, spaceships and even craft toys!</i>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <b>I lived most of my childhood in the countryside</b> and in my first interactions with technology I was
        fascinated by just how magical it looked. I was used to watching cartoons on a tube TV, but being able
        to talk to someone from another city in real time and even play "snake" was next level for me at the time.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <i>I'm glad I have the chance to explore this weird, yet <b>fantastic</b>, tech world and study the
        ins and outs of how things work, even being able to <b>create my own video games!</b></i>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <b>My favorite things to do</b> are walking in the woods (to get that  good ol' vitamin D), learning new things and creating stuff.

        <h2>What I've been doing</h2>
        <p>
        Currently I'm just focused on studying, but I have a lot of things in mind like <b>creating more complex games</b>
        that have a start and ending point or <b>maybe even uploading a YouTube video.</b>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <i>The latter is a bit tricky though because (as you may have noticed) I didn't grow up speaking english,
        so I've been <b>training my pronunciation</b> to sound reasonably good.</i>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        I'm also <b>willing to take part in more Game Jams</b> whethever they pop up, because I love the thrill
        of participating and how they push me into making and trying out new things.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <i>I've also been waiting patiently for the release of <b>Silksong</b> hahah.</i>
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        I'll update this part of the website when I get some project going on.

        The internet is a mess these days and I kinda gave up on social media (I'm looking at you <i>Elon</i>),
        but if you really want to send me a message talking about how bad this yellow background hurts your eyes
        or you just want to chat with me, feel free to message me over <b>denil918@duck.com</b>
