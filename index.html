                            One of my coolest Scratch games! I made it in early 2019, when I was 12 years old. <br>
                            I like looking back at it and seeing how much I've grown since then :)

            <div class="project">
                <h3 translate="no"><i>O Pingo do Conhecimento</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to help kids <span class="marker">learn through video-games!</span><br>
                    The main point here is the game <i translate="no">Pingo no Mundo da Matemática</i> (Pingo in the World of Mathematics),
                    a platformer about an adventurous cat set on a quest to free his world from math monsters
                    that are causing trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My vision is for it to be played in schools as <span class="marker">an uplifting activity that can help students
                    learn and practice math while having fun</span> - and with technologies like Chromebooks being more available in schools
                    near where I live, I can totally see that happening!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project started in September 2023 with the support of my English teacher from school. I developed
                    an alpha version of the game to be presented at a state science and innovation fair,
                    and it was a total success! The project got founded,
                    and by the end of this year I'll be releasing a complete version of the game to be played
                    in schools and by anyone <span class="marker">without any costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
