            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                <b>My name is Denilson</b> and I'm a 16 years old boy who enjoys
                creating stuff and playing some games.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I remember playing with building blocks and cardboard as a kid,
                creating whatever my imagination would bring to me, I would build
                castles, spaceships and even craft toys!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>I lived most of my childhood in the countryside</b> and in my
                first interactions with technology I was fascinated by just how
                magical it looked. I was used to watching cartoons on a tube TV,
                but being able to talk to someone from another city in real time and
                even play the game "snake" was next level for me at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I'm glad I have the chance to explore this weird, yet <b>fantastic</b>,
                tech world and study the ins and outs of how things work, even being able
                to <b>create my own video games!</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>My favorite things to do</b> are walking in the woods (to get that
                good ol' vitamin D), learning new things and creating stuff.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="current">
            <h1>What I've been doing</h1>
            <p>
                Currently I'm just focused on studying, but I have a lot of things in mind
                like <b>creating more complex games</b> that have a start and ending point
                or <b>maybe even uploading a YouTube video.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The latter is a bit tricky though because (as you may have noticed) I
                didn't grow up speaking english, so I've been <b>training my
                pronunciation</b> to sound reasonably good.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also <b>willing to partake in more Game Jams</b> whethever they pop up,
                because I love the thrill of participating and how they push me into making
                and trying out new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I've also been waiting patiently for the release of <b>Silksong</b> and <b>Create Aeronautics</b> hahah.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I will update this part of the website when I get some project going on.
