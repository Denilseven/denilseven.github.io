            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                <b>My name is Denilson</b> and I'm a 16 years old boy who enjoys
                creating stuff and playing some games.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I remember playing with building blocks and cardboard as a kid,
                creating whatever my imagination would bring to me, I would build
                castles, spaceships and even craft toys!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>I lived most of my childhood in the countryside</b> and in my
                first interactions with technology I was fascinated by just how
                magical it looked. I was used to watching cartoons on a tube TV,
                but being able to talk to someone from another city in real time and
                even play the game "snake" was next level for me at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I'm glad I have the chance to explore this weird, yet <b>fantastic</b>,
                tech world and study the ins and outs of how things work, even being able
                to <b>create my own video games!</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>My favorite things to do</b> are walking in the woods (to get that
                good ol' vitamin D), learning new things and creating stuff.

                    <h1>Gear Loop</h1>
                    <p>A short parkour-platformer game that I made for a game jam in less than a week!</p>
                    <p>
                        This was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1 and
                        of the 735 games submitted to this jam, Gear Loop ranked 73rd!
                        It's by far my highest scoring game in a game jam this big, and it's also one of my favorites,
                        sometimes I catch myself playing it, trying to find a way to complete the levels even faster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feedback on this game was so positive that I'm going to remake it and turn it into
                        a fully fledged game. If you're a fast runner, keep an eye out!

                    <p>One of my coolest Scratch games!</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>I created this game when I was just 12</b> (I feel old now XD) and named it Dancing "Sub Zero" because at
                        the time I was really into Geometry Dash SubZero, it's likely that the robot's faces were also inspired by Geometry Dash!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afterwards I made <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/441173053/">a remastered version</a> with
                        better animations, menus and a list of songs you can choose from, but the first version feels more nostalgic
                        and "legit" to me.

                    <p>A brief history of a fish who walks (swims) the path of revenge.</p>
                    <p>
                        The main mechanic of this game is recruiting other fish to help you defeat the protagonist's
                        archenemy. As you recruit more fish, they swim in a formation that makes them look like
                        one big fish.

                        Differently from the other jams I've partaken so far, this was a national game jam (from
                        Brazil) and out of the 304 games submitted, this game made it into
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/z_rDUXn5lK8?si=1nM8dcJxPUEW_oQ9&t=5759">
                        a livestream</a> showcasing the top 50 games!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're going to play, beware of the traps, they're a little.. unfair. It's kind of hard
                        to balance the difficulty of a game when you're making it on the rush of the jam.

            <h1>What I've been doing</h1>
            <p>
                Currently I'm just focused on studying, but I have a lot of things in mind
                like <b>creating more complex games</b> that have a start and ending point
                or <b>maybe even uploading a YouTube video.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The latter is a bit tricky though because (as you may have noticed) I
                didn't grow up speaking english, so I've been <b>training my
                pronunciation</b> to sound reasonably good.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also <b>willing to partake in more Game Jams</b> whethever they pop up,
                because I love the thrill of participating and how they push me into making
                and trying out new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>I've also been waiting patiently for the release of <b>Silksong</b> and <b>Create Aeronautics</b> hahah.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I will update this part of the website when I get some project going on.
